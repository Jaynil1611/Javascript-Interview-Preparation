## Toast Notification

Q. Upon clicking Info button and Warning button toast notification should popup at the bottom of the screen and if Error button is clicked error notification should popup at the top of screen.

This problem tests css skills as well as knowledge of JavaScript DOM APIs. It is not expected to know all DOM APIs, feel free to ask for help.

This can be enhanced more. Further, you can add a close button on the toast notification which closes the toast.
