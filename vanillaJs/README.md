## Toast Notification

Q. Upon clicking Button1 and Button2 toast notification should popup at the bottom of the screen and if Button3 is clicked error notification should popup at the top of screen.

This problem tests css skills as well as knowledge of JavaScript DOM APIs. It is not expected to know all DOM APIs, feel free to ask for help.

This can be enhanced more. Further you can add a close button on a toast notification.
